# Exercises and Labs for Chapter 5

## Exercises

1.  **Edge Detection Application**: Describe a robotic task where edge detection would be a critical first step in visual processing. Provide an example of how the detected edges could be used.
2.  **Object Detection Comparison**: Compare and contrast a two-stage object detector (e.g., Faster R-CNN) with a one-stage object detector (e.g., YOLO) in terms of accuracy, speed, and typical use cases in robotics.
3.  **Visual Servoing vs. Traditional Pose Control**: Explain why visual servoing might be preferred over a traditional pose control method (where the robot first estimates the object's pose and then moves to it) for tasks involving compliant interaction or moving targets.

<h2>Labs</h2>

1.  **Basic Image Processing with OpenCV**: Using Python and OpenCV, load an image, convert it to grayscale, apply a Gaussian blur, and perform Canny edge detection. Display the original and processed images.
2.  **Object Detection with Pre-trained Model**: Use a pre-trained deep learning object detection model (e.g., from TensorFlow Hub or PyTorch Hub) to detect objects in an image or video stream. Visualize the bounding boxes and labels. (This can be done using a simple Python script).
