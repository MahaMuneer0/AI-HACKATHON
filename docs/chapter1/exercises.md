# Exercises and Labs for Chapter 1

## Exercises

1.  **Foundational Concepts Review**: Define and differentiate between Physical AI and traditional AI. Provide three examples of each.
2.  **Robot Component Identification**: For a common household appliance (e.g., a robot vacuum cleaner or a smart speaker), identify potential actuators, sensors, and control system elements. Describe their function.
3.  **Historical Impact Analysis**: Choose one significant historical development in robotics (e.g., the introduction of Unimate, the Mars rovers, or the emergence of collaborative robots) and discuss its impact on industry or society.

## Labs

1.  **Simple Actuator Control (Simulation/Hardware)**: Using a basic programming environment (e.g., Python with a simple motor library or a simulator like V-REP/CoppeliaSim), write code to control a simulated or physical DC motor. Experiment with speed control.
2.  **Sensor Data Acquisition**: Connect a simple distance sensor (e.g., ultrasonic or IR) to a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi). Write code to read sensor data and display it. Analyze how environmental factors affect readings.
