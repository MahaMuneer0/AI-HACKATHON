# Exercises and Labs for Chapter 8

## Exercises

1.  **HRI Modality Selection**: For a robot designed to assist in a hospital setting (e.g., delivering medication), discuss which communication modalities (speech, gesture, haptics, visual cues) would be most appropriate and why, considering factors like noise, urgency, and user abilities.
2.  **Cobot Safety Features**: Describe the key safety features that enable collaborative robots to work safely alongside humans without traditional safety fences.
3.  **Ethical Implications of Social Robots**: Discuss two ethical concerns that arise specifically from the development and deployment of social robots (e.g., emotional manipulation, privacy, impact on human relationships).

<h2>Labs</h2>

1.  **Robot Speech Interaction Simulation**: Implement a simple text-to-speech and speech-to-text interaction with a simulated robot. The robot should be able to respond to a basic command (e.g., "hello", "move forward") with a spoken confirmation. (Can use Python libraries for speech recognition/synthesis).
2.  **Simulated Collaborative Task**: Design a simple collaborative task between a human and a simulated cobot (e.g., passing objects, co-carrying). Implement basic safety logic that causes the cobot to pause or slow down if a human is detected too close in the shared workspace.
