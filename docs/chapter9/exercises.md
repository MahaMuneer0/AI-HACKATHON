# Exercises and Labs for Chapter 9

## Exercises

1.  **Soft Robot Design Considerations**: Given a task that requires grasping fragile or irregularly shaped objects, explain why a soft robot gripper might be preferred over a traditional rigid gripper. What are the key design challenges for such a gripper?
2.  **Cloud Robotics Benefits and Drawbacks**: Discuss the main advantages and disadvantages of using a cloud robotics architecture for a fleet of delivery robots. Consider aspects like cost, processing power, security, and connectivity.
3.  **Future Impact of Quantum Robotics**: Speculate on a specific robotic application that could be fundamentally transformed by the advent of practical quantum computing. How would quantum capabilities change its functionality?

<h2>Labs</h2>

1.  **Bio-inspired Locomotion Simulation**: Research a bio-inspired locomotion mechanism (e.g., snake-like, insect-like, fish-like). Implement a simplified simulation of this locomotion in a physics engine (e.g., PyBullet, Gazebo) to demonstrate its basic movement principles.
2.  **Cloud Robotics Data Offloading (Conceptual)**: Design a conceptual architecture for a cloud robotics system where a mobile robot offloads heavy computation tasks (e.g., large-scale map building or complex path planning) to a remote server. Describe the data flow and communication protocols required.
