# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Kit Workflow
All work must be guided by the Spec-Kit workflow: constitution → specify → plan → tasks → implement.

### II. AI-Assisted Iterative Workflow
The book must be produced using an AI-assisted iterative workflow with Claude Code.

### III. Unified Structure, Tone, and Formatting
All chapters must follow a unified structure, tone, and formatting standard.

### IV. Accurate, Pedagogically Sound, and Accessible Content
Content must be accurate, pedagogically sound, and accessible to beginners.

### V. Production-Ready, Reproducible, and Deployable Deliverables
Deliverables must be production-ready, reproducible, and deployable through GitHub Pages.

### VI. Improvable Artifacts
Every generated artifact (text, code, diagrams) must be improvable through refinement cycles.

### VII. Auditable and Traceable Outputs
All outputs must be auditable and traceable back to their Spec-Kit phase.

### VIII. Minimal and Deterministic Toolchain
The toolchain must stay minimal and deterministic: Docusaurus + GitHub Pages + Spec-Kit Plus + Claude Code.

### IX. Clarity, Modularity, Version Control, and High Writing Quality
The project must maintain clarity, modularity, version control discipline, and high writing quality.

### X. Adherence to Specification and Plan
Implementation details must always follow the defined specification and plan—never bypassing the workflow.

## Project Constraints

- All content must remain within the Docusaurus documentation system.
- Only standard supported formats may be used (Markdown, MDX, JS/TS config files).
- GitHub Pages is the required deployment environment.
- The writing must be fully understandable to students with no robotics background.

## Success Conditions

- A complete textbook website is deployed publicly.
- All chapters are organized, navigable, consistent, and technically accurate.
- The project’s artifacts reflect strict adherence to Spec-Kit methodology.
- The workflow can be reproduced by another developer using only the repo + Spec-Kit

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All PRs/reviews must verify compliance.
