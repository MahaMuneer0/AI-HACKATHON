Overview:
Define the full set of functional, non-functional, and acceptance requirements
for producing the AI-generated textbook website using Docusaurus, Claude Code,
and Spec-Kit Plus. All requirements must comply with the constitution.

Functional Requirements:

1. Textbook Structure
   - The system must generate a complete textbook titled:
     "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — A Modern Introductory Course".
   - The textbook must contain multiple modules/chapters organized hierarchically.
   - Each chapter must include:
     - Theory explanations
     - Practical examples
     - Diagrams (ASCII or tool-generated)
     - Exercises or labs
   - Chapters must follow a unified template for consistency.

2. Docusaurus Integration
   - A new Docusaurus project must be initialized.
   - The textbook content must be stored in the /docs directory.
   - A sidebar navigation structure must be auto-generated via sidebars.js.
   - The site must build successfully via:
     npm install
     npm run start
     npm run build

3. GitHub Pages Deployment
   - The textbook must be deployed to GitHub Pages.
   - Deployment must be handled by:
     - Docusaurus’s built-in deploy script, or
     - GitHub Actions workflow.
   - The final site must be accessible via public URL.

4. AI-Assisted Generation
   - Claude Code must be used to produce all chapters, examples, and diagrams.
   - Spec-Kit Plus must control the workflow (constitution → specify → plan → tasks → implement).
   - All content must be iteratively refined, not generated in a single pass.

5. Documentation Assets
   - Include a README explaining:
     - The purpose of the book
     - Build instructions
     - Deployment instructions
     - Toolchain overview (Spec-Kit, Claude Code, Docusaurus)

Non-Functional Requirements:

1. Writing Quality
   - Must be clear, beginner-friendly, and logically structured.
   - Must avoid unnecessary jargon unless explained.
   - Must support readers with no prior robotics experience.

2. Consistency
   - All chapters must use unified formatting:
     - Heading structure
     - Code block formatting
     - Diagrams style
     - Terminology

3. Maintainability
   - The project must remain modular and easily extendable.
   - All content must be version-controlled with Git.
   - No non-essential dependencies are allowed.

4. Reliability
   - The Docusaurus site must build without errors.
   - Links, references, and navigation must remain functional.

5. Aesthetic & Usability Requirements
   - The site must be clean, readable, responsive, and accessible.
   - Navigation must be simple and intuitive.
   - Code examples must be easy to copy and run.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. A complete Docusaurus site builds successfully.
2. All textbook chapters exist with polished content.
3. GitHub Pages deployment is live and accessible.
4. Repo contains:
   - docs/ (all textbook content)
   - docusaurus.config.js
   - sidebars.js
   - /static (if used)
   - Deployment workflow
   - README.md
5. All work aligns with the constitution and Spec-Kit methodology.
